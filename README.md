# Home Assistant Blueprints

Some Home Assistant Blueprints I use

## Motion Light

This triggers a light depending on a motion sensor.
It uses a Night Mode to define the color (Night = red, Day = White)

## Motion Light White

This triggers a light depending on a motion sensor.

## Heater Window

Disables the heater if window is opened and reenables it afterwords.
We have a heat pump and due to that we want to turn on the heater everytime after the window closes.
